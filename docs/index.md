## What Do XML Files Do?
XML files are what controls how the GamePlate plugin runs a map. XML gives you full control over creating unique gamemodes and concepts that aren't possible through command blocks. By using our XML framework, you are able to construct a game with the same level of polish as other industry leading networks.

## Writing XML Files
We recommend using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) when working with XML files. Sublime Text helps you format your XML so you can configure maps faster.
