## What is XML?
XML is what controls how the GamePlate plugin manages a map. By utilizing XML, map makers are able to construct gamemodes with far more polish and control than Command Blocks.

## How to write XML?
We recommend using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) when configuring maps.
